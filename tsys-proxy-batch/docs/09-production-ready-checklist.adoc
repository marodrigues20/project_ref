= Production Ready Checklist

This checklist must be completed _before_ the microservice is deployed into a production-like environment.

The contents of this checklist is from Production-Ready Microservices by Susan Fowler.

== Stable and Reliable
* Does the service have an automated pipeline?
* Does the service contain unit, integration and end-to-end tests?
* Are the users of the microservice known?
* Are the dependencies known?
* Are there backups, alternatives, fallbacks and caching in place in case of failures?
* Can the service be routed to correctly?

== Scalable and Performant
* What are the qualatative growth scales and how do they relate to this microservice?
* What are the quantative growth scales for this microservice, keeping the qualatative growth scales in mind?
* Have the resource bottlenecks are requirements been identified?
* Is capacity planning automated and performed on a scheduled basis?
* Will the dependencies scale with the microservice?
* Will the microservice scale with the clients?
* Has the microservice been written in a programming language that allows it to be performant and scalable
* Is the way tasks are being handled performant?
* Is the way data is being stored performant and scalable?

== Fault Tolerance
* Are there any single points of failure?
* Have all failure scenarios and catastrophes been identified
* Has the microservice been subjected to chaos testing?
* Is failure detection and remediation automated?
* What are the standard incident and outage procedures?

== Monitoring
* Have the key metrics been identified and are they being monitored?
* Do the logs accurately reflect the past states of the microservice?
* Do the dashboards for the microservice contain all key metrics and are they easy to interpret?
* Are the alerts for the microservice actionable and are they defined by signal-providing thresholds?
* What is the on-call procedure for handling incidents and outages?

== Documentation
* Is the documentation sufficiently comprehensive?
* Is the documentation up-to-date?
* Does the documentation contain:
    * A description of the microservice
    * An architecture diagram
    * Contact and on-call information
    * Links to important information
    * An onboarding and development guide
    * Information about the service's request flows, endpoints and dependencies
    * On-call runbook
    * Answers to FAQs
* Is it well understood at a developer, team and organisational level?
* Does it meet the standard for a production-ready microservice?
* Has the architecture been reviewed and is it audited frequently?
