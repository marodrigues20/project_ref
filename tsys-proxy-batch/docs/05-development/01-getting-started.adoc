= Getting Started

This page represents the documentation that will allow a new team member to get this microservice up and running.  The aim
is to allow a new team member, (new to the company or from another team) to start operating the code locally.  This will then form
a basis to understand the rest of the operating manual.

* Prerequisites - SDKs, tools, account setup
* Repo location - Where the microservice source could can be found.
* Commands - What command should be executed to build, test and run the microservice.
* Extra reading - What other areas of the operating manual should be explored now the service is up and running.

The content of this page is very specific to each team, but the aim is to bring a new team member up to speed so they can
contribute.
